This project is a Internet-of-Things Weather Sensor that reads humidity and temperature levels in a room and relays this data across the internet to a smartphone on the Blynk cloud platform. The hardware components of this project are an ESP32 microcontroller used to host a Wifi network, a DHT11 humidity and temperature sensor module, jumper wires, and a solderless breadboard. This project makes use of the `WiFi.h` module to enable internet capabilities, the `BlynkSimpleEsp32.h` library to connect the Blynk cloud platform with the device, and the `DHT.h` library to provide humidity and temperature data sensing capabilities. All software is developed in the Arduino version of C++ within the Arduino IDE.
